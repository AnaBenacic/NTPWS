		<p>The arts or creative arts are a vast range of human practices of <b>creative expression</b>, <b>storytelling</b>, and <b>cultural participation</b>. The arts encompass diverse and plural modes of thinking, doing, and being in an extensive range of media.</p>
		<p>Both dynamic and a characteristically constant feature of human life have developed into stylized and intricate forms. This is achieved through sustained and deliberate <b>study</b>, <b>training</b>, or <b>theorizing</b> within a particular tradition, generations, and even between civilizations.</p>
		<p>The arts are a vehicle through which human beings cultivate distinct <b>social</b>, <b>cultural</b>, and <b>individual identities</b> while transmitting values, impressions, judgements, ideas, visions, spiritual meanings, patterns of life, and experiences across time and space.</p>
		<p>Prominent examples of the arts include: <b>visual arts</b> (including architecture, ceramics, drawing, filmmaking, painting, photography, and sculpting), <b>literary arts</b> (including fiction, drama, poetry, and prose), and <b>performing arts</b> (including dance, music, and theatre).</p>
