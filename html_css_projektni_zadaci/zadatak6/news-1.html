			<h2>Introduction to cross stitching</h2>
			<p class="description">Here's everything you need to know about cross stitching!</p>
			<p>Cross stitching is a form of <b>sewing</b> and a popular form of counted-thread <b>embroidery</b> in which X-shaped stitches in a tiled, raster-like pattern are used to form a picture.</p>
			<p>The stitcher counts the threads on a piece of evenweave fabric (such as <b>linen</b>) in each direction so that the stitches are of uniform size and appearance. This form of cross-stitch is also called counted cross-stitch in order to distinguish it from other forms of cross-stitch.</p>
			<p>Sometimes cross-stitch is done on designs printed on the fabric (stamped cross-stitch); the stitcher simply stitches over the printed pattern.</p>
			<p>Cross-stitch is often executed on easily countable fabric called <b>aida cloth</b>, whose weave creates a plainly visible grid of squares with holes for the needle at each corner.</p>
			<p>The cross-stitch can be executed partially such as in quarter-, half-, and three-quarter-stitches. A single straight stitch, done in the form of <b>backstitching</b>, is often used as an outline, to add detail or definition.</p>
