			<h2>Read recommendation: Uzumaki by Junji Ito</h2>
			<p class="description">Dive into the world of spirals!</p>
			<p>Uzumaki (うずまき, lit. 'Spiral') is a Japanese <b>horror manga</b> series written and illustrated by <b>Junji Ito</b>.</p>
			<p>Appearing as a <b>serial</b> in Shogakukan's weekly seinen manga magazine Big Comic Spirits <b>from 1998 to 1999</b>, the chapters were compiled into three bound volumes published from August 1998 to September 1999. In March 2000, Shogakukan released an omnibus edition, followed by a second omnibus version in August 2010. In North America, Viz Media serialized an English-language translation of the series in its monthly magazine Pulp from February 2001 to August 2002. Viz Media then published the volumes from October 2001 to October 2002, with a re-release from October 2007 to February 2008, and published a hardcover <b>omnibus</b> edition in <b>October 2013</b>.</p>
			<p>The series tells the story of the citizens of Kurouzu-cho, a fictional town which is plagued by <b>a supernatural curse involving spirals</b>. The story for Uzumaki originated when Ito attempted to write a story about people living in a very long terraced house, and he was inspired to use a spiral shape to achieve the desired length. Ito believes the horror of Uzumaki is effective due to its subversion of symbols which are positively portrayed in Japanese media, and its theme of protagonists struggling against <b>a mysterious force</b> stronger than themselves.</p>
			<p>Uzumaki continues to receive critical acclaim, deemed by many as Ito's <b>magnum opus</b>. The manga has received generally positive reviews from English-language critics. It was nominated for an Eisner Award in 2003, and placed in the Young Adult Library Services Association's list of the "Top 10 Graphic Novels for Teens" in 2009.</p>
			<p>In 2000, the manga was adapted into two <b>video games</b> for the WonderSwan and a Japanese <b>live-action film</b> directed by Higuchinsky. An <b>anime television series</b> adaptation co-produced by Production I.G USA and Adult Swim premiered in September 2024 in the United States on Adult Swim's Toonami programming block.</p>
